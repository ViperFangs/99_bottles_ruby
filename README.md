# 99_bottles_ruby
Repository for code related to "99 Bottles of OOP" book by Sandi Metz

Personal Notes:

I have been absent from GitHub from some time now, this is because I have decided to dedicate some time to read books related to testing/refactoring/designing code. I know I understand coding to the point where I can code Connect 4 or Chess. However, I know that the code I will write won't be clean code (i.e will be full of code smells). Further, I am going to use refactoring.guru to increase my knowledge in design patterns.

During my free time I like to watch videos related to networking and ethical hacking, so I decided to make an account at tryhackme.com to play games like
-> Capture the Flag (CTF)
-> King of the Hill (KoTH)
-> Bug Bounties
